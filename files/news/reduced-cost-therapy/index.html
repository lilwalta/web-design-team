  <p>Mental health care is essential, but for many people, the cost of therapy can be a serious barrier. Open Path Psychotherapy Collective was created to change that. 
    This nonprofit organization connects individuals, couples, and families with licensed therapists who offer affordable therapy sessions to those in need.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Open Path Psychotherapy Collective?</h2>
  <p>
    Open Path Psychotherapy Collective is a group founded in 2012 in the San Francisco Bay Area by Chris Elliot, Elizabeth Hanks, and Alexander “Sandy” Clarke.
    Open Path is a national nonprofit network made up of licensed mental health professionals who are committed to increasing access to therapy. 
    The organization helps people who are uninsured, underinsured, or facing financial hardship find quality counseling at a reduced cost.
    Members pay a one-time lifetime fee of $65, which gives them access to a network of therapists who agree to charge between $30–$70 per session for 
    individuals and $30–$80 for couples and families.
  </p>

  <h2>Who's Eligible?</h2>
  <p>
    Open Path is designed for people who can't afford support without additional assistance. To be eligible you must be one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Uninsured</li>
      <li>Underinsured (current insurance has too large of a copay or has no coverage at all)</li>
      <li>Current college student</li>
      <li>Experiencing significant financial struggle</li>
    </ul>
