# **Web Design Team**
### The Official Website For SHS BPA Website Design Team 435 <br>

https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=101b05-f5fcf0-378056-5d825a-37807A&fonts=Inter-Inter <br>
https://thrivewell.org/# has neat accessibility features<br> 
Another thing: BPA State is March 2-4 and this needs to be done before then.
FINAL Adjustments:

Resource page needs a graph to show where/what the money goes to and the zip resource thing needs to be done
The search bar needs to have actualy backend function
The forum will be a signup/login page then the forum (will probably be hard to setup this will be a more than one person thing during a meeting)<br>


### Externalities ### <br>
* Best domain for price is $4.28 and it's thrivewell.website, I think one of us can host it or get it free hosted by github or other.
* However, I think it would be professional and cool to have an email server setup with an admin email etc.
* We need social media websites setup for thrivewell with some small posted material (news/events/whatever)
* Get a real gofundme started
