Another thing: BPA Regionals is December 13th and we have to submit website before then.

I'll let you know some things here:
Work on base functionality for regionals, main pages, chat rooms, aesthetics, etc.
Then for state and nationals we work on the complex things like advanced backend, hosting, complex animations, 3d elements, working chat rooms with clean look.
Also we may need to change logo because I was looking at domains and ThriveWell is actually a really common name for websites that relate to health, and I don't want to seem like we are copying.
Finally, our color pallete may need to change but since I added all colors as root in CSS that is an easy fix.
