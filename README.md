Another thing: BPA Regionals is December 13th and we have to submit website before then.

### I'll let you know some things here:  ### <br>
*  Work on base functionality for regionals, main pages, chat rooms, aesthetics, etc. <br>
* Then for state and nationals we work on the complex things like advanced backend, hosting, complex animations, 3d elements, working chat rooms with clean look. <br>
* Also we may need to change logo because I was looking at domains and ThriveWell is actually a really common name for websites that relate to health, and I don't want to seem like we are copying. <br>
* Finally, our color pallete may need to change but since I added all colors as root in CSS that is an easy fix. <br>

FINAL LAYOUT:
Take action will be a things you can do, charities and finally goals/motives of the website<br><br>
A resources page will have some contact info using a database to find your area to find local helplines then the national helplines will be on there. The data will show graphs on things like mental health in certain areas then what are money will go to/has gone too. this will be added onto with animations, interactive charts, and geolocation<br><br>
The forum will be a signup/login page then the forum (will probably be hard to setup this will be a 3 person thing during a meeting)<br>
Final thing I want to work on together is making sure parts of the website are actually relevant to mental health like color scheme, info, footer, etc.<br>
